# Shortest Job First (SJF) Calculator

## Overview

Welcome to the **Shortest Job First (SJF) Calculator** project! This application simulates process scheduling using the SJF algorithm, both preemptive and non-preemptive, and visualizes the results using a Gantt chart.

## Features

- **SJF Algorithms:** Calculate SJF scheduling either preemptively or non-preemptively based on user selection.
- **Gantt Chart Visualization:** Display a visual representation of scheduled processes using a Gantt chart.
- **Input Validation:** Ensure accurate input handling and error messages for invalid inputs.

## Usage

1. **Input Process Data:**
   - Enter the number of processes, their IDs, arrival times, and burst times in the respective fields.
   - Optionally, select the preemptive SJF checkbox for preemptive scheduling.

2. **Calculate SJF:**
   - Click the "Calculate SJF" button to compute the scheduling based on the selected algorithm.

3. **View Results:**
   - The calculated average turnaround time (AvgTAT) and average waiting time (AvgWT) are displayed.
   - A Gantt chart visualizes the scheduled processes along with their completion times.
